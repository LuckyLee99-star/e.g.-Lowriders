<article>In the mid-twentieth century in Southern California, colorful painted classic cars would cruise the boulevards. From Cadillac El Dorados to Chevy Impalas, these lowriders were rolling art installations with chrome rims and white wall tires, with the cars meant to be driven "low and slow" as they hugged the pavement. Set on hydraulics, the cars would be able to, in the flip of a switch, become lowriders one second and street-legal vehicles the next.</article>
